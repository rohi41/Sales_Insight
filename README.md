# AtliQ Sales Insights PowerBi Dashboard
This is a project I replicated from Codebasics PowerBi Youtube playlist.

# Problem statement
AtliQ hardware is a company which delivers computer hardware & peripheral Manufacturers to his clients, which has several branches throughout India. The sales director of the company is facing a lot of issues in terms of understanding how the business is performing and what are all the problem company is facing currently as the sales are not as expected and declining gradually. And whenever he calls the regional managers to get the current status of the sales and market, as a human behaviour, these people sugar cote the truth and send tons of Excel files instead of disclosing the truth, which made the sales director more frustrated. Humans are not comfortable in consuming numbers from excel files, which is obvious reason for the frustration.

# Solution
Sales director of the AltiQ hardware, decided to build a PowerBI Dashboard for converting the data into visual representation to make data driven decisions. So, he hired a team of data people to complete this task.


# Steps Followed in this project
1. Performed a High level analysis of data in SQL to get better understanding over the data.

2. Connected the SQL data set to PowerBI.

3. Performed ETL and data cleaning on the imported data.

4. In the currency there were two types of currencies in transactions, performed currency conversion to make all the currency type same

5. Created measure for needs and used them for creating visuals in PowerBi.

6. After the initial report reviewed by the stakeholders, made changes to the report based on the review commends.
